  "text": "Begin by settling into a comfortable position. Let your body rest in a way that feels kind and supportive. If it feels right, gently close your eyes. Take a slow breath in through your nose, and a soft breath out through your mouth. Allow the pace of your breathing to slow, without forcing it. There is nowhere else you need to be. This moment is enough.\n\nAs you breathe in, imagine a gentle warmth forming at the center of your chest. It may feel like a soft glow, a quiet light, or simply a sense of ease. This is the space where love lives within you—not something you have to create, but something that already exists. With each inhale, allow this warmth to grow a little brighter, a little fuller, as if it is being patiently nourished by your breath.\n\nNow, as you exhale, imagine that warmth flowing outward from your chest. It moves easily, like light spilling into the space around you. You are offering love without effort, without expectation. There is no need to decide who deserves it or where it should go. Simply allow it to radiate outward, gentle and free.\n\nContinue breathing like this—receiving on the inhale, giving on the exhale. Notice how natural this rhythm feels. Giving and receiving are not separate actions here; they are part of the same soft cycle. You do not lose love by offering it. Each time you give, you create more room within yourself to receive.\n\nNow, imagine someone you care for—perhaps someone who feels safe and comforting to you. As you exhale, allow your warmth to reach them. You may silently wish them peace, ease, or rest. Notice how this offering feels in your body. There is no strain, only quiet connection.\n\nIf it feels okay, gently widen this circle. You might include people you see in passing, or those who share your world in small ways. You do not need to know their stories. Simply acknowledge their humanity, offering the same gentle warmth.\n\nYou may also notice someone with whom you feel distance, difficulty, or unresolved emotion. There is no need to force anything here. Simply recognize that love can be offered in very small ways—perhaps as understanding, or as space. Even choosing not to harden your heart is an act of care.\n\nNow return your attention to yourself. As you inhale, imagine love flowing back toward you. It arrives without judgment, without conditions. You do not need to earn it. All
