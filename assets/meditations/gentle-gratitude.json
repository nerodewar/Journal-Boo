  "body": "Hi.\n\nTake a moment to settle.\nYou don’t need to feel grateful for everything.\nYou don’t need to force a bright mood.\nThis is not that kind of gratitude.\n\nThis is simply a gentle noticing.\nA quiet practice of letting small goodness be seen.\n\nIf it feels okay, let your body relax a little.\nFeel the support beneath you.\nNotice your breath moving in and out.\n\nNow, instead of searching for something huge, look for something small.\nSomething that asked very little of you.\nSomething simple and real.\n\nIt might be the feeling of warmth from a cup of tea.\nA blanket.\nThe way the light looks on a wall.\nA message you received.\nA moment of quiet.\nA shower.\nClean water.\nA deep breath.\nEven the fact that you made it through today.\n\nChoose one small thing.\nAnd let it be enough.\n\nBring it to mind.\nNot like a checklist.\nMore like you’re holding it in your hands.\n\nAnd notice what it feels like to acknowledge it.\nMaybe nothing changes.\nMaybe you feel a slight softening.\nMaybe a tiny lift.\nOr maybe you just feel neutral.\nAll of that is okay.\n\nNow, gently, see if you can name why this small thing mattered.\nNot in a grand way.\nJust honestly.\n\nMaybe it gave you comfort.\nMaybe it gave you a pause.\nMaybe it made life easier for a moment.\nMaybe it reminded you that you’re cared for.\n\nTake one slow breath in.\nAnd as you breathe out, let your body register:\n“Yes. This helped.”\n\nNow, if you want, find one more small thing.\nSomething different.\nSomething you can appreciate without pressure.\n\nIt could even be a neutral thing that you’re choosing to notice.\nThe steadiness of the floor.\nThe presence of a chair.\nThe fact that your lungs are working.\nThe fact that you’re here.\n\nBring it close.\nAnd let it land.\n\nSometimes gratitude is not a feeling.\nSometimes it’s a practice of attention.\nA way of saying:\n“I’m willing to see what’s still here.”\n\nIf today has been hard, you don’t need to pretend it wasn’t.\nHard days deserve honesty.\n\nSo if you need to, you can include this too:\n“I’m grateful I survived today.”\nOr:\n“I’m grateful I’m still trying.”\nOr:\n“I’m grateful I found one small moment to breathe.”\n\nNow take a final slow inhale.\nAnd a slow exhale.\n\nLet gratitude be gentle.\nLet it be small.\nLet it be real.\n\nAnd when you’re ready, return your attention to the room.\nTo your body.\nTo this moment.\n\nThank you for practicing.\nYou can come back to this anytime — especially when it’s hard."
